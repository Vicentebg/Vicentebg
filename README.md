## Hello I'm Vicente 

I am a professional with a degree in Computer Science, specializing in DevOps. Throughout my career, I have gained significant experience as a Java developer, working with the Spring Boot framework during my internship. This experience provided me with a solid foundation in software development, allowing me to understand the challenges and requirements of the application development lifecycle.

Later, I transitioned into the role of DevOps, where I developed expertise in CI/CD automation and implementing modern infrastructure solutions. My skills include building and maintaining continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines, using tools like Jenkins, Git, and Docker to ensure fast and reliable software releases. Additionally, I am proficient in Linux platforms, with practical experience using tools such as Portainer, Harbor, Kong API, and Swagger.

I am currently expanding my skill set by learning AWS and Python, recognizing the importance of these technologies in the current cloud and automation landscape. Furthermore, I bring experience in on-premise environments, complementing my knowledge of infrastructure.

I am passionate about finding innovative solutions to complex challenges, and my experience in DevOps has allowed me to effectively collaborate in multidisciplinary teams to drive operational efficiency and continuously improve software development and delivery processes.

I am seeking challenging opportunities in the DevOps field where I can apply my technical skills and knowledge in a dynamic, results-oriented team. I am confident that my experience and passion for technology make me an exceptional candidate to drive the success of any project or organization.
